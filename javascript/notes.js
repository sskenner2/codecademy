>> LOOPS >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
"javascript performs several types of repetative operations, called "looping".
Loops are sets of instructions used to repeat the same block of code till a
specified condition returns false or true.  Counters, variables that increments
or decrements with each repetition of the loop, can be used for control."

loop statements: for and while
for = "loop a specific # of times .. till a specified condition returns false"
while = "loop an undetermined number of times .. as long as a specified condition
  returns true"
do/while (a variant of the while) = "execute code block once .. then check if
  condition is true .. repeat loop as long as the condition is true"

>> FLOW CONTROL >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
if / else if / else
isNaN = "checks to see if object is Not a Numer"
switch / case / default / break

>> LOGICAL OPERATORS >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
"control programs given multiple conditions"
and (&&)
or (||)
not (!)

>> ARRAYS & OBJECTS >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
"objects are just collections of information (keys and values) btw curly braces"

>> OBJECTS I >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
objects > "store all relevant information in one place"
property (category label) > "each piece of info included in an object"
dot notation > "ObjectName.PropertyName"
bracket notation > 'ObjectName["PropertyName"]'

literal notation >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
var objectName = {
  objProperty1: "property1",
  objProperty2: property2
};

constructor >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
var objectName = new Object();
objectName.objProperty1 = "property1";
objectName.objProperty2 = property2;

method >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
objectName.methodName = function (){
  // statement
}
objectName.methodName()

> ".. can be used to change object property values"
> ".. can be used to make calculations based on object properties .. unlike
functions which can only use parameters as an input" [http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp]
